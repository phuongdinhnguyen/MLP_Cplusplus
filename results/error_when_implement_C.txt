- converting formulas to code: not as easy as Python
(flexible, varities of variables/data structure, functions)
(C is very strict in defining types and variables)
-> thank god we have debugger

- memory hungry (using ~3gb of RAM) -> needs more optimization
- nan numbers -> caused by softmax  -> normalize softmax
